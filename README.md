# fractals
A program that generates the various fractals using mouse position as parameter in complex plane

This is a project of the graphics branch of 42.
It is built with library 'minilibx' in C, which includes very basic graphics functions such as putting a pixel on screen.

## Features
* Simple file format definition (array of space-separated integers)
* 3D rotations with the mouse
* Camera controls (zoom, translate)
* Color gradients controled by keyboard (separate RGB adjustments)

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on OS X.

Run with `./fdf [map]`. A bunch of sample maps are provided in the `test maps` directory.
